🌟 The Problem & Our Solution
Millions are left behind in healthcare due to language barriers. A patient describing symptoms in their native Bengali often gets lost in translation before reaching a doctor.

Bhasha-Arogya (Language-Health) is an AI-powered prototype designed to be that crucial bridge. It captures nuanced, village-level Bengali symptom descriptions and translates them into structured clinical data for doctors, ensuring nothing gets lost.

⚠ Critical Disclaimer: This is a prototype for demonstration and research purposes only. It is NOT a certified medical device and should NEVER be used as a substitute for professional diagnosis, advice, or treatment.


🚀 Key Features
Feature	Description	Impact :
🧠 Intelligent Symptom Parsing	NLP-powered extraction of symptoms, severity, duration, and potential red flags from colloquial Bengali.	Turns unstructured patient language into actionable, structured data.

🚨 Red Flag Detection	Automatically highlights urgent warning signs (e.g., "shosh hoye jacche" - severe dehydration) for immediate attention.	Prioritizes critical cases and alerts clinicians.

💊 AI-Powered OTC Suggestions	Leverages OpenAI GPT to generate safe, general-purpose over-the-counter medicine advice. Clearly labels it as non-prescriptive.	Provides educational context for common, minor ailments.

🔄 Doctor-Patient Translation	Converts complex English doctor instructions back into simple, understandable Bengali for the patient.	Closes the communication loop and improves health literacy.


## Tech Stack
Backend API: Python + FastAPI (High-performance, async-ready)
Frontend UI: React (with TypeScript for type safety)
AI & NLP: OpenAI GPT API + Custom Bengali regex/lexicon mappers

Authentication: (Optional) JWT / OAuth2

📖 How It Works: The User Journey
1. Patient Input: A user describes their symptoms in natural Bengali:
   "আমার পেটে খুব ব্যথা, বমি বমি লাগছে, এবং জ্বর হয়েছে গতকাল থেকে।" 
2. Structuring & Analysis: Our backend parses this into:
{
  "symptoms": ["abdominal pain", "nausea", "fever"],
  "severity": "severe",
  "duration": "1 day",
  "red_flags": []
}

3. AI Suggestion: GPT suggests general OTC advice (e.g., hydration, rest, common antacids) with clear disclaimers.
4. Doctor's Turn: A doctor reviews the structured data, makes a diagnosis, and types advice in English.
5. Closing the Loop: The doctor's advice is translated back into simple Bengali for the patient to understand.

🧪 Example API Flow
Endpoint: POST /api/parse-symptoms
Request (Bengali Text): 
{
  "text": "মাথা ব্যাথা এবং সারা শরীরে জ্বর আছে।"
}
Response (Structured JSON):
{
  "structured_data": {
    "symptoms": ["headache", "fever"],
    "severity": "mild",
    "duration": "unknown",
    "red_flags": []
  },
  "ai_advice": "For general headache and fever, rest and hydration are recommended. Over-the-counter pain relievers like paracetamol may help. Consult a doctor if symptoms worsen.",
  "translated_advice": "মাথাব্যথা এবং জ্বরের জন্য বিশ্রাম এবং জলখাবার সুপারিশ করা হয়। প্যারাসিটামলের মতো ওভার-দ্য-কাউন্টার ব্যথানাশক সাহায্য করতে পারে। লক্ষণগুলি খারাপ হলে একজন ডাক্তারের সাথে পরামর্শ করুন।"
}
